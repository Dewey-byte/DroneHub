## 🛸 About

**DroneHub** is a platform designed to support drone-related workflows — such as **data visualization, remote control integration, flight monitoring, or backend support for drone services**.  
This project can serve as:

- A **drone control dashboard**
- A **data display manager**
- A **backend for drone telemetry or command routing**
- A **prototype for real-world drone applications**

*(Replace this description with specifics based on the code and purpose of your repo.)*
